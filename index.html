    <p2 class="Republican">Senator cruz introduced a bill that would require manufacturers of certain internet connected devices to clearly and conspicuously that there is a either a microphone and/or camera on said device. The bill excludes smartphones and other devices that people can reasonably assume to have microphones.
       <br> Recently big tech companies have been finding ways to sell your data and will employ any method they can to gain information on you, so they can sell it. This bill would protect people from being unknowingly recorded on devices that regularly do not have microphones or cameras. The bill has been introduced to the senate but it has yet to pass into the House of Representatives. :(
